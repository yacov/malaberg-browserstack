### **16\. Sylius Backend Integration Enhancements**

To align the codebase with the PRD's objective of integrating Sylius backend commands:

#### **Implement Sylius Command Execution**:

-   **Develop Methods for Command Execution**:  
    Use PHP's `exec()` or Symfony's `Process` component to execute Sylius backend commands from within the tests. These methods can be encapsulated within utility classes or integrated into existing context classes.
    
-   **Create Backend Validation Steps**:  
    Write step definitions that trigger backend commands and verify their outcomes. Steps could include actions like resetting the database, generating test data, or verifying backend processes.
    
-   **Ensure Backend and Frontend Alignment**:  
    After executing backend commands, use frontend tests to verify that the changes are reflected in the UI. This ensures data consistency between the backend and frontend systems.
    

___

### **17\. Future Test Development**

-   **Visual Regression Testing**:
    
    -   **Integrate Percy**:  
        Plan the integration of Percy for visual regression testing to detect UI inconsistencies across different browsers and devices. Update test scripts to capture screenshots at key points and compare them against baseline images.
-   **AI-Based Visual Validation**:
    
    -   **Leverage OpenAI API**:  
        Explore using the OpenAI API for intelligent UI comparisons. Implement AI-based validation steps that can understand and compare complex UI layouts beyond pixel-by-pixel comparison.
-   **Expand Test Scenarios**:
    
    -   **Edge Case Testing**:  
        Develop tests for edge cases such as invalid inputs, network failures, and error handling scenarios. Include tests for security vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other common attack vectors.
        
    -   **Administrative Workflows**:  
        Write tests for admin user functionalities, such as product management, order processing, and user management. Ensure that internal operations align with both backend processes and frontend representations.
        
-   **API Testing**:
    
    -   **Sylius API Endpoints**:  
        Plan to include automated tests for Sylius API endpoints using tools like Postman or REST-assured. Validate the correctness of API responses, status codes, and data integrity.
-   **Performance Testing**:
    
    -   **Load and Stress Testing**:  
        Incorporate performance testing to evaluate how the application behaves under high load. Use tools like JMeter or Locust to simulate multiple users and identify potential bottlenecks

### **18\. Project Architecture Overview**

-   **Modular Context Classes**:
    -   Each page or feature is represented by its own context class (e.g., `ProductPageContext`, `CartPageContext`), improving modularity and separation of concerns.

-   **Shared Data Management**:
    -   Introduced `SharedDataContext` to handle data sharing across contexts.
    -   This allows for memorized data (e.g., product details, shipping info, order numbers) to be accessible throughout the test scenarios.

-   **Page Object Model (POM)**:
    -   The codebase follows the Page Object Model pattern, where each page is represented by a class encapsulating its elements and interactions.

-   **Reusability and Maintainability**:
    -   By separating concerns into specific context and page classes, the codebase is more maintainable and scalable.

___

### **19\. Instructions for AI Coder Agents**

To maintain consistency and adhere to the project's architecture and coding standards, AI coder agents should follow these guidelines when adding new features or pages:

#### Adding a New Page

1.   **Create a New Page Class**:
    -   In the `src/Page/` directory, create a new class representing the page (e.g., `NewPage.php`).
    -   Extend `BasePage` and implement methods corresponding to the page's functionalities.

2.   **Create a Context Class for the Page**:
    -   In the `features/bootstrap/` directory, create a new context class (e.g., `NewPageContext.php`).
    -   The class should implement `Context` and contain step definitions specific to the new page.
    -   Inject `SharedDataContext` if data sharing is needed.

3.   **Update Feature Files**:
    -   Add new scenarios or steps to existing feature files, or create a new feature file under `features/`.
    -   Ensure that the steps correspond to the step definitions in your context class.

4.   **Define Element Selectors**:
    -   In your page class, define the selectors for the page elements.
    -   Use descriptive and maintainable selector strategies (e.g., CSS selectors, XPath).

5.   **Use SharedDataContext for Data Sharing**:
    -   If you need to share data across contexts (e.g., memorizing information), use the `SharedDataContext`.
    -   Set and get data using methods provided by `SharedDataContext`.

6.   **Follow Coding Standards**:
    -   Adhere to PSR-12 coding standards for PHP.
    -   Write clear and informative comments.
    -   Use meaningful method and variable names.

#### General Coding Guidelines

-   **Modularity**: Keep context classes focused on specific pages or features.
-   **Reusability**: Implement reusable methods in page classes.
-   **Error Handling**: Include appropriate exception handling and provide clear error messages.
-   **Documentation**: Include docblocks for classes and methods.

___

### **20\. Additional Instructions**

-   **Element Selectors Management**: Maintain a consistent approach for element selectors.
-   **Test Data Management**: Use data tables in Gherkin steps for input data when appropriate.
-   **Logging and Reporting**: Implement logging within tests for better debugging.
-   **Continuous Integration (CI) Considerations**: Ensure tests can be integrated into CI pipelines.
-   **Performance Optimization**: Avoid unnecessary waits or sleeps; use proper synchronization methods.
